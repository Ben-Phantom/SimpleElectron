# An electron APP Framework
* The framework could be used to create a simple electron app quickly without coding much.

* The only thing you maybe need to do is to write a front_end web page. ðŸ˜ƒ

## How to use
* Make sure you have the correct nodejs, npm, yarn environment

* The *side_creation* is just like its name -- no use but previous code I personally dnt wanna delete.

* And the framework could also help beginners learn how to write a simple electron program (maybe)

#### Enter the root directory
```
cd <The_name_of_the_root_directory>
```
#### Install dependencies
```
yarn install
```
#### Run the APP
```
yarn electron
```
